                    <p>A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers. 
                        Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out 
                        and food delivery services. The process consists of a customer choosing the restaurant of their choice, 
                        scanning the menu items, choosing an item, and finally choosing for pick-up or delivery. 
                        Payment is then administered by paying with a credit card or debit card 
                        through the app or website or in cash at the restaurant when going to pickup.

                    <p>When a kitchen makes its own pizza dough, making just the right amount of dough is perhaps the toughest 
                        balance to strike. Make too little dough and you'll run out of pizzas, losing out not only on immediate 
                        profits, but also risking the longer-term damage of appearing unreliable and diminishing customer loyalty.

                    <p>The reason why most of us practice meditation is that it helps us to find inner peace, improves 
                        perception, helps brain to rest, helps us to stay in the present moment and most of all perfects 
                        our sense of contentment as a whole. There is plenty of research about the positive effects of 
                        mediation towards comprehensive well-being of people.
